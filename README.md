Get daily email update on how many cherry trees are blooming at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.

## Goal
I wanted to go see cherry blossoms at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. They do have a website with a diagram displaying blooming status, **but it's tedious to check there everyday and they don't offer any notification like emailing**.

## Design
![alt text](assets/design.jpg)
* Playwright browser automation for screenshot
* Langchain to anyalyze screenshot and extract statistics with Gemini on GCP
* Redis db for storing emails and Resend for sending emails


## Misc notes 
* reduce size of image for a smaller payload (token wise)
* temperature should be lowest
